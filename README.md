# Hello World Deploy
A simple, no-infrastructural-frills Amazon ECS deployment script

## Dependencies
To run, make sure you have Ansible 2.4 or greater, curl, and Node.js 6 or greater.

## Usage
### Set environment variables
Set `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_REGION` appropriately in your environment.

### Run it
`./deploy.sh`

## OMG YOU COMMITTED AN RSA KEY
I know, it's here for example purposes only. It's not used for anything outside of this sample deployment script.

...as long as you don't use it in production. That'd be a bad idea. Don't do that. Replace it with `ssh-keygen`.
